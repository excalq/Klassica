# Klassica2

Klassica is an open-source Classified Ads Platform developed by Arthur Ketcham. It has been running at Walla Walla University (http://klassica.wallawalla.edu) since 2007. Klassica is owned and managed by Kaskadia Software Studios and is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version3.

This version (version 2.0.2) is fairly old, and is probably not adequate for production use. A port to Ruby-on-Rails for version 3 is under-way. This code is available for informational purposes, and Arthur Ketcham and Kaskadia assume no risk for its use.

**Important:** The WWU specific authentication plugin has been removed in this public repository. This will break auth (and any page that includes it). The default login code (login/index.php) will need to be used instead.
